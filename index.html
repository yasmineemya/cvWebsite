  <h2>Welcome to My ePortfolio</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! My name is Yasmine Chiboub, and this ePortfolio showcases my journey as a coder, designer, and problem-solver.
    Here, I highlight my coding projects that reflect my growth in software development, web design, and technical creativity.
    Each project demonstrates the skills, challenges, and solutions I encountered while building real-world applications and websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    My theme for this ePortfolio is: <strong>A good life is like building a bridge</strong>.
    Just like constructing a bridge, coding requires planning, connecting different components, debugging issues, and continuously improving.
    Each project in this ePortfolio represents a piece of that bridge, showing how persistence, learning, and creativity come together to create meaningful results.
  </p>
  <p>
    I invite you to explore my coding projects to see how I approach problem-solving, design, and implementation.
    I hope this ePortfolio gives you insight into my work, my learning process, and the skills I have developed along the way.
    Thank you for visiting!
