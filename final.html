    <h2>Final Reflection Letter</h2>
    <p><strong>Theme:</strong> <em>A good life is like building a bridge.</em> This ePortfolio has been the scaffold where I connected course learning to personal growth, step by intentional step.</p>

    <p>Creating this ePortfolio shifted the way I view assignments: they stopped being isolated tasks and became evidence of progress. At first, my site felt like a digital storage space for finished work. As I sorted through files and chose artifacts, it transformed into something more purposeful — a narrative of how I learn and improve. Selecting artifacts forced me to ask: which pieces truly show growth, and what do they prove about my skills or thinking? Grouping related projects into pages helped me present a clearer story. Each page now functions like a bridge span: some are solid and need little change, others need more reinforcement, but together they form a structure that will support future learning and opportunities.</p>

    <p>One thing that worked well was organizing early and intentionally. I split content into four themed pages and added short intros that tie each page back to the theme. Instead of keeping all projects in a single long list, I distributed them across focused pages so a visitor can follow a coherent progression. Writing a brief reflection for each artifact made the learning visible — not just the finished product, but the decisions that shaped it, the challenges I met, and the lessons I took away. Doing small reflections as I went meant the final, longer reflection felt natural and accurate rather than rushed.</p>

    <p>Not everything went smoothly. Choosing which artifacts to include was tougher than I expected. I had to resist including everything and instead choose items that best demonstrated growth and critical thinking. Several technically polished projects lacked reflective depth, so I rewrote captions to explain my thinking process and how feedback changed the final outcome. I also ran into technical issues with layout and file embedding. Troubleshooting small CSS/HTML problems taught me practical front-end skills, and although those fixes took time, they made the site easier to navigate and better looking. Time management was another challenge: updating the portfolio while juggling other coursework sometimes meant edits happened late at night and needed revision afterward. Scheduling short, focused editing sessions helped me improve quality without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

    <p>One unexpected benefit was that the ePortfolio highlighted connections between classes and personal goals. A coding assignment that once felt only technical became a story about problem solving and persistence when paired with a reflection on debugging strategies and collaboration. A communication assignment turned into an example of audience awareness when I included presentation slides and peer feedback. These cross-links made my narrative stronger: my work is not isolated, but interconnected, with each artifact supporting broader skills and ambitions.</p>

    <p>Overall, this project changed my perspective on academic work. The portfolio is now evidence of continuous learning rather than a static collection. It’s something I can show during internship applications or interviews, but its primary value is personal: I can look back and see concrete progress. That sense of visible growth boosts my confidence and motivates me to set more ambitious goals. Going forward, I plan to keep the ePortfolio active — adding artifacts, revisiting reflections, and updating the site as my skills develop. I will also write short reflections right after major assignments so learning remains fresh and visible.</p>

    <p>Thank you for reviewing my ePortfolio. I welcome feedback on ways to deepen reflections, improve clarity, and better align future artifacts with the overall theme. This site is a living document — it shows where I am now and points to where I want to go next.</p>
