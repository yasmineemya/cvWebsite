    <h2>Final Reflection Letter</h2>
        <p>
            Honestly, I never know how to start these things so I'm just gonna talk the way I talk. My name is Yasmine and I'm trying my best to grow in life even tho sometimes it feels like life is running faster than me. English is not my first language so sometimes my grammar be fighting for its life, but honestly I don’t even care because I feel like as long as people understand me then it's okay.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m a computer science major, which is kinda funny because when I was younger I never thought I would be sitting here writing code for hours and then crying because one semicolon is missing. But here I am, learning Python again for the 100th time because everytime I take a break I forget everything like my brain just deletes it on purpose. But I'm trying to get better this summer, like actually learn everything deep so when I code I don’t feel like a confused potato.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also wanna get into cybersecurity because it just feels so cool to be able to protect systems and like understand how things work behind the scenes. Plus when I was younger I hacked my school computer during quarantine, which now that I look back at it was kinda wild but also lowkey impressive. I just like figuring out how stuff works, like computers, people, even random things like why cats act like they pay rent when they don’t.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of school I’m actually a really goofy person. People always tell me I have a big personality and that I talk too much but in a good way, like I motivate people without even meaning to. My friends always tell me “Yasmine talking to you makes me want to get my life together,” and honestly that makes me happy because sometimes I feel like I’m lost too, so the fact that I can help people while I'm lost myself is kinda beautiful in a weird way.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love exploring places, especially abandoned places or just random aesthetic spots around Charlotte. Sometimes me and my friends just drive with no money and no plan, like “okay where are we going?” and we just figure it out on the way. And honestly those are the best nights. My favorite memories come from times where I wasn’t even doing anything crazy, just being around people I love. I like playing soccer with my family, having game nights, taking pictures of literally anything that looks cute, snowboarding even tho I fall like every 2 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m also someone who wants to be successful so bad, not even for the money but so my future kids can have a good life. I want a family one day, like a peaceful one, loving one, not chaotic. I want my kids to look at me and be proud, not like “dang my mom is embarrassing.” And I want to be able to support them, travel with them, teach them things, all that cute stuff.
        </p>

        <p>
            I know I got a lot to work on — school, discipline, learning more, staying consistent — but I'm getting there slowly. Even if I fall off, I always get back up. I’m driven, I’m curious, I’m dramatic, I’m funny, I love to explore, and I really believe I’m gonna make something big out of my life. And if my grammar not perfect, oh well. It’s me, and I’m growing anyway.
